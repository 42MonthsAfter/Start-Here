# Welcome to 42 Months After!
We a community that runs 3 different flavors of DayZ servers:

## On Your Own : Hard Core Survival
Harest of the hard core survival servers, this flavor of DayZ is based on realism and is not for the faint of heart. Freezing temps, customized zombies, no luxuries like position on maps, player HUD markers, or even a map unless you have one on you... We are looking to make this an extreme challenge for those who love DayZ and respect the difficulty and grind of vanilla DayZ.

## Abandoned : PvE + Role Play
For those looking for a more laid back grind, Abandoned combines 90% PvE with 10% high tier loot PvP zones and a trader called The Holler. If you're into base building (BB+) or just coming over from console and want to cut your teeth on PC DayZ, this will be a welcome challenge. Role playing isn't required to play Abandoned, but it would be a lot more fun for everyone if you did.

## Murdle Isle : PvP Deathmatch
This is just for shit and giggles, and is a ton of fun. Placed on Swans Isle, a small island north of Deer Isle, this server is nothing but high tier weapons fully kitted out and gear basically falling at your feet. The only goal here is to be the last one standing. Hit `H` for your leader board to see where you are ranked, just keep in mind that it resets everytime your character dies.
